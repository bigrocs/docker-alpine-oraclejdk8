# docker-alpine-oraclejdk8
This image is based on Alpine Linux image, which is only a 5MB image, and contains
* Alpine 3.7

* [OracleJDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html).

You must accept the
[Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for Java SE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html)
to use this image (see #6 for details).

JDK bundle contains lots of unnecessary for Docker image stuff, so it was cleaned up.
